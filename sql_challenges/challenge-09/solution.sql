-- Lesson 04: Class Exercises
-- Students: work through these in order. Don't skip the verify steps.

-- ============================================================
-- EXERCISE 1: Manual transaction (warm-up)
-- ============================================================
-- Transfer $50 from Charlie (3) to Alice (1) using BEGIN / COMMIT manually.
-- Before: verify balances. After COMMIT: verify again.

-- Your SQL here:

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 50 WHERE account_id = 3;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 50 WHERE account_id = 1;

SELECT account_id, owner_name, balance FROM accounts ORDER BY account_id;

COMMIT;

-- ============================================================
-- EXERCISE 2: Catch yourself with ROLLBACK
-- ============================================================
-- Start a transfer of $10,000 from Bob (2) to Charlie (3).
-- Before committing, check the balances. Does Bob have enough?
-- Use ROLLBACK to undo. Verify balances restored.

-- Your SQL here:
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 10000 WHERE account_id = 2;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 10000 WHERE account_id = 3;

SELECT account_id, owner_name, balance FROM accounts ORDER BY account_id;

ROLLBACK;

SELECT account_id, owner_name, balance FROM accounts ORDER BY account_id;

-- ============================================================
-- EXERCISE 3: SAVEPOINT checkpoint
-- ============================================================
-- You need to:
-- 1. Add $25 to Alice's balance
-- 2. Set a savepoint
-- 3. Deduct $25 from Charlie's balance (wrong account — you meant Bob)
-- 4. Rollback to savepoint
-- 5. Deduct $25 from Bob's balance instead
-- 6. Commit

-- Your SQL here:

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 25 WHERE account_id = 1;

SAVEPOINT AA;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 25 WHERE account_id = 3;  -- Charlie, not Bob

ROLLBACK TO AA;

SELECT account_id, owner_name, balance FROM accounts ORDER BY account_id;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 25 WHERE account_id = 2;

SELECT account_id, owner_name, balance FROM accounts ORDER BY account_id;

COMMIT;

-- ============================================================
-- EXERCISE 4: Write your own stored procedure
-- ============================================================
-- Create a procedure called deposit_funds(p_account_id, p_amount)
-- It should:
-- 1. Validate that p_amount > 0 (raise error if not)
-- 2. Add p_amount to the account balance
-- 3. COMMIT on success
-- 4. ROLLBACK + re-raise on any error
-- Test it with: EXEC deposit_funds(3, 75);

-- Your SQL here:
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE deposit_funds(
    p_account_id  IN  NUMBER,
    p_amount    IN  NUMBER
) AS
    v_balance  NUMBER;
BEGIN
    -- Check sufficient funds before doing anything
    SELECT balance INTO v_balance
    FROM accounts
    WHERE account_id = p_account_id;

    IF v_balance < p_amount THEN
        RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Insufficient funds in account ' || p_account_id);
    END IF;

    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + p_amount WHERE account_id = p_account_id;

    COMMIT;

    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Transfer complete: $' || p_amount ||
                         ' to account ' || p_account_id);
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        ROLLBACK;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Transfer failed. All changes rolled back.');
END;

--Test
SELECT account_id, owner_name, balance FROM accounts ORDER BY account_id;

EXEC deposit_funds(3, 75);

SELECT account_id, owner_name, balance FROM accounts ORDER BY account_id;

-- ============================================================
-- EXERCISE 5: Discussion
-- ============================================================
-- Answer these in words (no SQL needed):

-- Q1: You're building a patient appointment booking system.
-- A booking requires:
--   a) Reserve the time slot
--   b) Create the appointment record
--   c) Send a confirmation notification
-- Which of these should be inside the transaction? Which should be outside? Why?
    -- The first two should be inside the transaction and the third outside, because the first two modify tables in the database, and the third one is just a confirmation notification (that should only be sent when the appointment is successful)

-- Q2: Your stored procedure calls COMMIT at the end.
-- A developer calls your procedure from inside their own larger transaction.
-- What problem does this create?
    -- It commits twice

-- Q3: You have a function called calculate_copay() and a procedure called post_payment().
-- A colleague wants to use calculate_copay() inside a SELECT statement.
-- Can they? Can they do the same with post_payment()? Why or why not?
    -- Yes they can, but they would need to use a temporary table and SELECT from there, because it can't be SELECTed by itself
